# ODDAssignment
### Overview:
### Purpose & Patterns- 
Accessing whether an ecosystem that contains high quality food will support a large and stable population for a specific species that utilizes this resource. 
### Entities, state variables, and scales- 
The species in focus and food source are the agents. The ecosystem of choice and species interacting with the species in focus are important aspects of the model. The spatial and temporal extent of the model will run with a 1-month cycle and in the home range of the specific species. Things to consider: Species size (large or small) and its searching behavior, food resource and its quality and accessibility.
### Process overview and scheduling-
As species size increases due to the high quality of food resource, there will be a decline in high-quality food. The species in focus will eventually reach a plateau on size. 
### Details (Initialization):
The initial conditions of the environment/agents include an ecosystem with low-quality food resources with a variety of species seeking beyond their home range for high-quality food sources. 
### Description of different subroutines/functions/actions that need to happen in the model: 
Still confused on this part.
